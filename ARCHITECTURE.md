## What is the problem?
Originally doodle effects need tremendous work for designer to draw.
Many software such as Adobe After Effect. Still this software suggest
half automatic(tracking) UI.
We will offer fully automatic software, also maintaining the idea of design.

Branch is made because of avoid interaction between other branch and master.

Look at the time of 32:42, and this video is basic information about making in C++ which
is not compatible for our project. However it is useful information to look for it.
